# Frontend conventions

- `apps/web` is a thin Next.js App Router shell; keep domain logic in packages.
- Route files should mostly wire `@forky/app-ui` screens and avoid local business logic.
- New screens go in `packages/app-ui/src/screens/<domain>`, features in `packages/app-ui/src/features/<domain>`.
- Use the design system in `packages/ui-kit` and UI helpers in `packages/shared-ui`.
- Use `@forky/state` for domain state and API access; avoid direct API calls in app shells and UI components.
- Add new client API calls in `packages/state/src/api` and wire them through state stores.
- Tailwind is the styling layer; keep components composable and use named exports.
